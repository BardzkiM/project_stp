###note
I was about to create project from scratch like this (maybe bigger) to work on setting up projects. It was really nice to have some inspiration, I had really good time doing it. I know there are lot of unnecessary libraries (eg. redux, sagas, reselct) and it could be done easier, but I just wanted to practice and set it up by myself :)
If you have any questions about the project, please do not hesitate to contact me (michalbardzki@gmail.com)
